![A simple timeline depicting a few key dates around the production of the first Star Wars prequel. It shows both events with single days, i.e. the beginning of writing, as well as longer timespans, i.e. the entire duration of pre-production, a range which contains multiple single-date events. At the top, there is UI for adding and removing events, zooming, and title.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5a4100c-0bca-41a9-adb4-d98bf4aacd6f "The example timeline")


## Roadmap

* improved display (avoid overlap)
* multiple lanes / channels for events
* ~~timespans (from/to/title) e.g. "Easter holidays" or "vacation"~~ (rudimentarily implemented September 2024)
